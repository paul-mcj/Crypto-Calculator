# Crypto-Calculator
This app works with the Coinbase open API, where it allows a user to convert any amount of a chosen crypto (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH) into its worth in some fiat currency. All prices use Coinbase's "spot price" in real time, which means it gathers the current market price for a cryptocurrency. A returned server time is given to inform the user that the price is current as well.
